# Bias for action! 
We need a bias for action. I learned these words from Shaan Puri on the My First Million podcast. Ol’ Uncle Shaan. Lots of good tidbits from him. You are now reading my first act. Writing a blog to clarify my thoughts; putting them out there to the world for better or worse.  Perhaps one day I can point back to this first post and say “woahhhh look how far we came old pal” as I relax into a lounge chair in the backyard of the breezy home I bought with my own money because I’m a multi-millionaire. 

What exactly will I be looking back on? Me right now in 2024. 33 years old. $35K/year earnings. $25K savings that is quickly dwindling. 3 years into a PhD program in Biotechnology. 2 dogs. A long-term partner. $2400/month + $300 in utilities for a 950sqft 2bd2br in a hell hole of a city. Not fit AF but decently healthy. Ambitious, hungry, and desperate to be free from working for other people. Desperate to be free of the prison that is being an employee to someone -- always shapeshifting to please and cater to and NOT GET FIRED. When I asked a friend what business they could see me running they said, “have you ever thought about donating plasma?”. Welp, gotta start somewhere. Belief in myself is the first step. And hey, I’m better off than I used to be. 

I can look back at 2016 where I was 25, had a massive drinking problem, terrible acquaintances, tens of thousands of dollars in debt, fired from multiple jobs, and also unwilling to give up on my dream of doing something big. That person pulled themselves together, sobered up, ditched the bad relationships, ditched the shitty jobs, ditched the self-destructive behaviors and addiction to the rollercoaster of face planting and starting again and got to where I am now. I honor that hot mess 25-year old express and appreciate how far they have come. Now, I cannot wait to honor the struggling academic and entrepreneur of me in 2024 and say, “look how far you came!!! Again!!!!”. You are incroyable and I knew you could do it. 

This time, I’m going to document the journey. I really wanted to the first time but I did not. Simple as that. It’s a shame really because to go from that place of confusion and muddled thoughts as a person transitioning from a controlled religious upbringing to an independent and unabashed adult was really something. The journey to independence, to being my own person, and becoming highly educated was one of personal ownership that it took me a long time to find for myself. Thus the blog title, “You can’t tell me what to do anymore”. I can say that now to all the people who held me back or tried to control me or set up situations where what I wanted most was behind the paywall of “do my bidding first”. Ugh. I recoil at the powerlessness I felt growing up. The inability to be myself and stand up for myself and what I believed was right and wrong. Always at someone else’s whim. Not anymore! 

I am free in person and in mind but not financially. Ohhhhh no, not financially. So that is my next step in the journey of “you can’t tell me what to do anymore”. I want to be truly free of the effed up people in power telling me what I can and cannot do as I try to make a living. As a PhD student, you are at the mercy of academic personalities who are often…. Unpleasant. More on that in later posts I’m sure, but to say I am free of the tyranny of others is not a luxury I have yet. 1.5 more years and I aim to be free. 1.5 more years and I will have a PhD as a trump card to say, “I am capable of producing independent knowledge and demonstrating mastery. I am useful to society.” On the journey to earning that valuable piece of paper, I need to take care of myself and take care of my family. As a PhD student I may be poor AF but I do have time independence. 

Time independence means I can manage my time how I please. And I spend a good amount of time each day taking care of my family and working on the PhD. But the other time I will start dedicating to making money. I am starting this blog because I have to do something. I have so much knowledge in my head from the years of consuming financial and business information from Guy Raz to Nicole Lapin to Tim Ferriss to Uncle Shaan Puri and Sam Parr to Rachel Rodgers and so many more content creators. I can’t just keep listening and doing nothing. I have to act. My small goal is to make $1000 by the end of 2024. My large goal is to double my income by the end of 2025. And I want to be a multi-millionaire by the time I am 40. 

I want to wield power through money and wave it around like *poof* your mortgage is paid, *poof* here is a scholarship fund for disadvantaged youth to get educated, *poof* here is a fund for poor grad students to attend international conferences, *poof* here is the money to upgrade the infrastructures of zip codes that are causing children to be sick because of the environmental pollution. I want to be free from people I do not like telling me what to do and how to do it and how to be because I don’t have the power to make my own choices. I can and I will make this happen. 

So, let’s get to it.
