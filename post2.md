# Belief in myself 

Hello again. It is day two, October 22, 2024, of publishing a blog post on “you can’t tell me what to do anymore  I am financially free and spend my money and my time as I will” central. What to write about today? Well, yesterday was implementing the bias for action. Today is belief. Belief in yourself. Belief in myself. 

I have two very loud voices in my head – Rachel Rodgers from We Should All Be Millionaires and Noah Kagan from Million Dollar Weekend. I basically always have Shaan Puri and Sam Parr in my head too, especially because Noah quoted both of them in his book. Shaan for something short and clever he said and Sam for his business pivot skills. Rachel is the voice of reason and the voice for my personal demons that tell me every day I do not deserve money, it is not worth pursuing, I am a bad person and not capable. Rachel’s case is that you should go make more money to be more useful. And Noah’s case is do something NOW. 

So combining all these voices in my head I am regurgitating something back on to this page that will lead me to my own first million dollars. Do I even believe that I can? Yes. I truly do. There are plenty of limits holding me back, especially the critical voices but remember my last post? I’ve already been to rock bottom baby and I bounced back. No matter what happens with this little journey that I am on I know that I will be fine and have fun. Business is FUN. 

I had a great brainstorm from Noah Kagan’s podcasting round that he did a few months ago and came up with some business ideas. What did I do with that? Oh, the typical. Come up with a great idea share it with five people, appreciate the affirmation from it and the move on. I did not actually want to do the idea. 

Here was the idea: leverage my experience as a PhD student with a strong biotech background, my previous career in the health insurance field, my undergrad experience in nutrition, and my certification as a personal trainer to gain credibility to an audience of lunch and learners at a local insurance brokerage. Ok, now that I am writing it down it is really a pretty great idea that I can keep iterating on. I actually went so far as to draft an email with the potential courses I could offer and send it to my mom. Then it died. Shriveled up and went to pasture. Why?

It shriveled up because I didn’t want to do it. I did not want to have to travel out of my way to go somewhere and be dressed nice when I do not have a car and live in a city that is punishingly hot a majority of the year. I DON’T OWN A CAR!!! I am a busy PhD student and am already maxed out on commuting to and from school. It takes me 1 hour each way, and if it is a day where I need to let the dogs out at lunch (I pay someone $10 sometimes) then it is 4 total hours of commuting (bike + public transit). So commuting to wherever the heck I would give these lunch and learn talks is suddenly very impractical. 

Ok byyyyye to that idea. But it has stayed in the back of my head because it’s a damn good story to leverage. I think back to when I was young and I could get a job in a second. In high school I had quite a few jobs – Quizno’s until I showed up to work one day and the place was shut down because the manager was shady AF, a bakery until I left because I was scared of getting fired (for good reason…), an usher for the opening season of our cities MLS team, and a bunch of random cash grabs like babysitting and yard work. That was high school. College, I found myself a job right away in campus catering services the summer before school started, then I worked for the intramural sports department, worked for a semester as the desk receptionist at a law firm, got hired as a part time illustrator for a local gaming company, became a coffee stand barista, started working at a restaurant as a server (got fired), started working at another restaurant as a server then became a bartender (ended up getting fired from there too). I LOVED learning something new and being in a different world but HATED the maintenance part once I knew the job things got boring. I did not know this about myself at the time and would cycle through several more rounds of hiring and firing before I learned to leave in a healthy way by the time my 26th year was wrapping up. 

Would you ever think that someone who cycled through about 30 jobs before the age of 27 would be successful as a PhD student? Me either. But the freedom of my time and managing my own schedule as a PhD student is so nice. I have the luxury of being my own boss (for the most part) and thinking for myself. This is what I always needed in a job. Not the strict rules of corporate dining, or the cloying role of serving people, or the monotonous sameness of working in account management at a desk. YUCK. I cringe to think of all those experiences. It’s funny looking back now though and being so grateful that I was pushed out out of all those jobs that were a bad fit for me so I could go out and try a bunch of new things. Now, I’m wiser and engineer that in to the work I do. Now, I will do that as an entrepreneur. Experiment, try, fail, try again at something new. It’s a well laid path for me – I just have always done it for other people not myself. 

Now, it’s for myself. I believe in myself and am ambitious as hell. Let’s do it.
