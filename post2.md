I heard Noah Kagan on Sam Parr and Shaan Puri’s podcast a few months ago and he gave us a challenge – next coffeeshop you are at, ask the barista for a 10% discount. Why? Because you have to ask to get what you want and this exercise is incredibly easy to implement. They say no? Great, you asked and got uncomfortable. They say yes? Great, you got something you asked for and would never have received otherwise. I felt something inside and knew I had to do it right then. There was a chop shop (a healthy food chain) that I was about to pick up lunch at, so I walked up to the register, ordered and said, “Can I have a 10% off?”. The lady looked at me and blinked, “the local business one?”. “Yes”. Ok, I may not have been a local business but I took it. I didn’t have any more cajones left to say, “No, I am just asking for 10% off”. Challenge passed? Suuuuure why not. I felt on top of the world after to be honest.

That little story reminded me that I can do anything I set my mind to. I’ve done it before. I may have had trouble with other people believing in me, which has held me back at times. But I never once doubted that I have the ability to achieve big things. When I set my mind to something, I get it done whether or not other people think I am a loser or think I will fail or think I am too dumb to do something (I found out most people who are close to me that have these expressions are just scared of me changing and leaving them behind). I aimed to get out of debt by the age of 30 and did it by 27. I wanted to get to become scientifically literate and wound up in a PhD program in a school of engineering. I wanted to take control of my life so I got sober and quit drinking. Now, I want to become independent through financial freedom as a multimillionaire. I will do it.
